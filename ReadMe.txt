Project Setup

Before proceeding with any tasks or running scripts in this project, it is essential to complete the Environment Setup to ensure a smooth and error-free experience.

Steps to Get Started

1) Make sure you have f-Droid installed
   f-Droid is an open-source app store for Android that allows you to easily download and install open-source apps, including Termux and its required extensions.
   - f-Droid is required for downloading Termux, a terminal emulator essential for the setup of your development environment.
   - Installing apps from f-Droid ensures you have control over open-source tools without needing the Google Play Store.

2) Make sure Termux:Boot is installed using f-Droid
   Termux:Boot is an add-on for Termux that allows you to run scripts automatically when your device boots up.
   - It is essential for automating cron jobs and tasks that need to start with your device.
   - This setup ensures that the necessary scripts can run on startup without any manual intervention, improving efficiency.

3) Complete the Environment Setup, in the environment-setup folder
   Follow the instructions in the **environment-setup** folder to install the necessary dependencies, configure your environment, and set up required credentials.
   - The setup will guide you through installing all necessary tools and libraries to ensure that everything works as expected.

4) Verify the Setup
   Ensure all required tools are installed and configured correctly by running the provided setup verification script (if available).

5) Begin Development
   Once the environment is ready, you can start working on tasks, scripts, or features as outlined in the project documentation.
